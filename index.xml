      <description>&lt;p&gt;We were facing a challenge as a team to move a legacy application to a microservices architecture. The application was built using .NET and was running on a monolithic architecture. We decided to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://kafka.apache.org/&#34;&gt;Kafka&lt;/a&gt; as our message broker to decouple the services and allow for asynchronous communication between them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This application was responsible to retrieve millions of operations on a daily basis and calculate the commission of each associated office and financial advisors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
