      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project is a RESTful API to keep the track of running amateur activities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve did it since I am an amateur runner.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, the API itself was not a work challenge, it was more a fun project to do in my free time. But I also took the opportunity to make all tests I&amp;rsquo;m aware of and I left a detailed explanation of each one of them in the readme of the project in &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/paolofullone/RunningTracker&#34;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project utilizes SignalR to send real-time data to one or more clients via WebSockets, in this example we are streaming the data from a SQL Server database to the clients.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instead of making a request/response paginated WebAPI, we decided to use SignalR in this specific project and the Consumer handles the data received. It was applied into a massive data scenario, were we could inquire the database for all orders confirmed by the stock exchange to evaluate some specific scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We were facing a challenge as a team to move a legacy application to a microservices architecture. The application was built using .NET and was running on a monolithic architecture. We decided to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://kafka.apache.org/&#34;&gt;Kafka&lt;/a&gt; as our message broker to decouple the services and allow for asynchronous communication between them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This application was responsible to retrieve millions of operations on a daily basis and calculate the commission of each associated office and financial advisors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
